Research 
Read the programming tasks for the day, given below. Carefully identify ALL the JavaScript functions and properties you will need to use, BEFORE writing any code. 
Make a list of the functions and properties you plan to use, with a one-line description. Show this list to the persons you are reporting to before proceeding with the programming. As far as possible, write clean & optimal javascript. 
What are Regular Expressions? Why are they used? How can you use regular expressions in JavaScript?
